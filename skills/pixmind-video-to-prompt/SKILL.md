# Pixmind video to prompt

Turn one video into a portable structured storyboard. The bundled script submits and polls Pixmind, parses the returned scene nodes, extracts reference frames locally, and emits a generic table presentation that compatible clients can render without Pixmind-specific code.

## Required confirmation

This API costs 100 credits per started minute, rounded up. It accepts one video per request and rejects videos longer than 10 minutes.

Before submitting:

1. Identify the video URL or local file, output language, and requested scene limit.
2. State the billing rule. If the duration is known, show the estimate: `ceil(seconds / 60) * 100` credits.
3. Ask for explicit approval to start the paid analysis.
4. Do not run a submission command until the user approves. Polling an already-created task does not require a second approval.

## Submit and wait

Use one source only. Default to `zh-cn` and 100 scenes unless the user supplied other values.

Remote video:

```bash
node {baseDir}/scripts/video-to-prompt.js --url "https://example.com/video.mp4" --language zh-cn --max-scenes 100 --yes --poll
```

Local video:

```bash
node {baseDir}/scripts/video-to-prompt.js --file "/path/to/video.mp4" --language zh-cn --max-scenes 100 --yes --poll
```

Resume an existing task without resubmitting or charging again:

```bash
node {baseDir}/scripts/video-to-prompt.js --task-id 12345 --file "/path/to/original.mp4" --poll
```

Keep the original source when resuming if screenshots are required. Supplying `--task-id` never submits another paid task; `--file` or `--url` is used only for local frame extraction.

## Local screenshots and FFmpeg

The script takes the midpoint of every returned `splits[index]`, extracts a 9:16 centered JPEG, and pairs it with `data[index]`.

1. Prefer `--ffmpeg`, then `PIXMIND_FFMPEG_PATH`, then system `ffmpeg`.
2. On Windows x64, if FFmpeg is absent, download the preferred full build from the Pixmind R2 manifest. Validate size and SHA-256 before execution; fall back to the next manifest version if necessary.
3. Never overwrite the source video.
4. Save screenshots and `result.json` under `~/Downloads/pixmind-video-to-prompt/{taskId}/` unless `--output` is supplied.
5. Screenshot extraction is local and free. It must not create or retry a Pixmind task.

## Output handling

- Read the final JSON object from stdout. It contains `storyboard`, local `screenshots`, `attachments`, the original `raw` response, and a generic `presentation` object.
- Prefer `presentation` when the host supports structured results. It contains the SaaS-equivalent sections and seven-column table without requiring client-specific Pixmind logic.
- Otherwise attach every file in `attachments` and render the scenes in a Markdown table with: scene number, reference image, duration, shot type, script, scene description, and video prompt.
- Present the result in this order: video description, video summary, video prompt, full storyboard prompt, then the storyboard table.
- Report the task ID so an interrupted analysis can be resumed without creating a duplicate paid task.
- Report screenshot success and failure counts. Do not claim screenshots came from the Pixmind backend; the bundled script extracts them locally from the original video.
- Treat `ready`, `success`, and `completed` as successful terminal states.
- Treat `failed`, `error`, and `cancelled` as unsuccessful terminal states and report the API message.
- Do not invent missing storyboard fields or submit a replacement task after failure unless the user explicitly approves another paid request.

## Errors and security

- HTTP 400: check that exactly one valid video was supplied and that it is no longer than 10 minutes.
- HTTP 401: configure `PIXMIND_API_KEY`; never ask the user to paste the key into chat.
- HTTP 402: report insufficient credits and stop.
- The API key is configured in the environment or the client's Pixmind provider settings.
